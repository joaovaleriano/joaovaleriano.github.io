I"É	<h1>Hello!</h1>

<p style="text-align:justify">I'm Jo√£o Valeriano. I've just finished my Bachelor in Physics by Universidade de Bras√≠lia (<a href="https://unb.br/">UnB</a>), Brazil, and started pursuing a Physics Master Degree at Instituto de F√≠sica Te√≥rica (<a href="https://www.ift.unesp.br/">IFT-Unesp</a>), S√£o Paulo, Brazil, where <a href="https://ictp-saifr.org">ICTP-SAIFR</a> is based. </p>

<p style="text-align:justify">During my Master degree, I expect to better understand how environmental chaotic flows shape microbial social interactions, considering the problem mainly through numerical simulations of models combining different techniques from game theory dynamical systems and stochastic processes.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">My Bachelor in Physics degree started in 2016 and, through its duration, I worked on different year-long projects at UnB, approaching themes including:</p>

<ul>
<li>Quantum Chaos characterization;</li>
<li>Phased array simulations for radio astronomy;</li>
<li>Ferrofluid Monte Carlo simulations.</li>
</ul>

<p style="text-align:justify">In 2018, I've participated on a two-week intensive research project with 7 other physics students at <a href="https://portal.cbpf.br/en-us/home/">CBPF</a>, where we developed and characterized a Josephson Junction. Also, in 2019, I was a student in the two-month long <a href="https://pages.cnpem.br/bolsasdeverao/">CNPEM Summer Scholarships Program</a>, during which I worked at the Brazilian Synchrotron Light Laboratory (<a href="https://www.lnls.cnpem.br/en/">LNLS</a>), <a href="../publications#cnpem">developing instrumentation for measurements of electrocaloric and electrostrictive effects</a>.</p>

<p>I graduated in 2020, with an <a href="../publications#tcc">Undergraduate Dissertation</a> focused on discrete time linear stochastic processes. Our main result was to show when to expect the gaussianization of the limit distribution, based on the system's eigenvalues.</p>
