<h3>Study of the Linear N-Dimensional Linear Map with Additive Noise through Lévy's Characteristic Function</h3>
<font size=2><b>J.P. Valeriano</b>. Supervisor: A.D. Figueiredo. Universidade de Brasília.</font>
<div style="text-align: justify">We study multilinear maps with additive noise, that is, stochastic linear difference equations, inpired by the discretization of stochastic differential equations, when we suppose the noise is constant by intervals. Integrating the stochastic differential equation on each interval, we obtain a stochastic difference equation. We show that the Central Limit Theorem can be seen as only a special case of a more general theorem describing the limit distribution of a stochastic process, and determine the necessary conditions for the limit distribution of each component of the system to be gaussian. Last but not least, we study the Langevin equation with the random force constant by intervals, and show that the velocity’s limit distribution is not necessarily gaussian but, if we reduce the time intervals to recover the stochastic differential equation, we obtain a normal distribution. Besides that, we consider the harmonic oscillator, damped or not, and its most interesting properties. <a target="_blank" href="../files/TCC-joao_valeriano.pdf">View PDF here.</a></div>

<h3>Instrumentation for the Study of the Electrocaloric and the Electrostrictive Effcts</h3>
<font size=2><b>J.P. Valeriano</b>. Supervisor: A.M.G. Carvalho, Co-supervisor: L.S.O. Paixão, LNLS/CPNEM.</font>
<div size=2 style="text-align: justify">Project developed during 2018 <a target="_blank" href="https://pages.cnpem.br/bolsasdeverao/">CNPEM Summer Scholarships Program</a>.</div> 
<div style="text-align: justify">This report presents the beginning of instrumentation development
for the study the electrocaloric effect and the electrostriction of samples of PVDF and PMN–10PT, by the research groups of the XRD1 beamline and the i-Caloric Materials Lab (LMiC), at LNLS, at CNPEM. Attempts were made to measure electrocalori effect directly, with a thermocouple directly attached to the samples, but no temperature variation was observed with the electric fields application. The prototype of a modified Sawyer–Tower circuit was developed to measure electric polarization, that still needs improvements to operate with the low capacitance samples, and will allow indirect measurements of temperature and entropy variations related to the electrocaloric effect. Electrostriction measurements were made through X ray diffraction with changing electric fields, and small strain results were obtained for the PVDF. <a target="_blank" href="../files/Relatorio_28o_PBV-joao_valeriano.pdf">View PDF here.</a></div>
